# Introduction to Machine Learning

## Key Takeaways
1. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence
2. Systems learn patterns from data without explicit programming
3. Three main approaches: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement
4. Training data quality directly impacts model performance
5. Applications include computer vision, NLP, and robotics

## 1. Machine Learning Fundamentals

### Definition and Scope

Machine learning represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence,
where systems learn patterns from data rather than following explicit
programming rules. As a subset of AI, machine learning enables computers
to improve their performance on tasks through experience and data exposure.

The fundamental principle involves providing algorithms with training data,
allowing them to identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human
intervention. This approach has revolutionized fields including computer
vision, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.

### Core Concepts

- **Training Data**: Dataset used to teach the algorithm patterns
- **Model**: Mathematical representation learned from data
- **Prediction**: Output generated for new, unseen inputs
- **Evaluation**: Measuring model performance on test data

The learning process involves iteratively adjusting model parameters to
minimize prediction errors. This optimization is typically achieved through
techniques like gradient descent, which systematically improves the model's
accuracy over multiple training iterations.

## 2. Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled training data where the desired output
is known for each input. The algorithm learns a mapping function from
inputs to outputs, enabling it to predict outcomes for new, unseen data.

**Common Applications:**
- Classification (spam detection, image recognition)
- Regression (price prediction, demand forecasting)
- Medical diagnosis
- Credit risk assessment

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns
and structures. Without predefined outputs, the algorithm must identify
relationships and groupings within the data independently.

**Common Applications:**
- Clustering (customer segmentation)
- Dimensionality reduction (feature extraction)
- Anomaly detection
- Market basket analysis

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning through trial and error
by receiving rewards or penalties for actions. The goal is to maximize
cumulative reward over time through optimal decision-making.

**Common Applications:**
- Game playing (AlphaGo, chess engines)
- Robotics control
- Autonomous vehicles
- Resource optimization

## 3. Neural Networks Architecture

### Layer Structure

Neural networks consist of interconnected layers of processing units called
neurons. Information flows sequentially through these layers, with each
layer transforming the data to extract increasingly abstract features.

**Architecture Components:**
- **Input Layer**: Receives raw data
- **Hidden Layers**: Process and transform information
- **Output Layer**: Produces final predictions

### Activation Functions

Activation functions introduce non-linearity into neural networks, enabling
them to learn complex patterns that linear models cannot capture.

📐 **Key Formulas**

$$
\text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x)
$$

$$
\text{Sigmoid}(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
$$

$$
\text{Tanh}(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}
$$

**Common Activation Functions:**
- **ReLU**: Most popular, computationally efficient
- **Sigmoid**: Outputs between 0 and 1, used for probabilities
- **Tanh**: Outputs between -1 and 1, zero-centered
- **Softmax**: Multi-class classification output

### Training Process

Training involves adjusting network weights to minimize prediction errors
through backpropagation and gradient descent optimization.

📐 **Key Formulas**

$$
\text{Loss} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

$$
w_{new} = w_{old} - \alpha \frac{\partial L}{\partial w}
$$

Where:
- $L$ = loss function
- $\alpha$ = learning rate
- $w$ = weights
- $y_i$ = actual values
- $\hat{y}_i$ = predicted values

## Glossary

**Activation Function**: Mathematical function applied to neuron output
to introduce non-linearity, enabling networks to learn complex patterns.

**Backpropagation**: Algorithm for computing gradients of the loss function
with respect to network weights, used to update parameters during training.

**Deep Learning**: Subset of machine learning using neural networks with
multiple hidden layers for hierarchical feature extraction.

**Gradient Descent**: Optimization algorithm that iteratively adjusts model
parameters in the direction of steepest descent to minimize loss.

**Machine Learning**: Subset of AI focused on algorithms that learn from
data to improve performance on tasks without explicit programming.

**Neural Network**: Computational model inspired by biological neural
networks, consisting of interconnected processing units (neurons).

**Overfitting**: Phenomenon where a model learns training data too well,
including noise, resulting in poor generalization to new data.

**Reinforcement Learning**: Learning paradigm where agents learn optimal
behavior through trial and error with reward signals.

**Supervised Learning**: Machine learning approach using labeled training
data where correct outputs are provided for learning.

**Unsupervised Learning**: Learning from unlabeled data to discover
inherent patterns and structures without predefined outputs.
