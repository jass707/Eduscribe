# EduScribe Project Setup Guide

## Current Status ✅
- Frontend is running successfully at http://localhost:3000
- All React components are working
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS is functional

## Recommended Project Structure

To organize your project with separate frontend and backend folders, here's what I recommend:

```
eduscribe/                    # Main project folder
├── frontend/                 # React frontend (current files)
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── lib/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── vite.config.js
│   └── ...
├── backend/                  # Backend API (to be created)
│   ├── src/
│   ├── requirements.txt      # For Python
│   └── ...
├── shared/                   # Shared utilities
├── docs/                     # Documentation
└── README.md                 # Main project README
```

## Steps to Reorganize:

1. **Create main project folder:**
   ```bash
   mkdir eduscribe
   cd eduscribe
   ```

2. **Move current frontend:**
   ```bash
   mkdir frontend
   # Move all current files from d:\store\notify to eduscribe\frontend\
   ```

3. **Create backend structure:**
   ```bash
   mkdir backend
   cd backend
   # Initialize your backend (Python Flask/FastAPI or Node.js Express)
   ```

4. **Update package.json scripts** in frontend folder to work from the new location

## Alternative: Keep Current Structure

If you prefer to keep the current working setup, you can:
- Keep frontend in `d:\store\notify\` (currently working)
- Create backend in `d:\store\notify-backend\`
- This avoids moving files and breaking the current setup

## Next Steps:
1. Choose your preferred structure
2. Set up the backend in your chosen framework
3. Configure API endpoints to match the frontend expectations

The frontend is fully functional and ready to connect to a backend API!
